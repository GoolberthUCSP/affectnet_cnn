# AffectNet CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify facial emotions using the **AffectNet** dataset. The model is trained to recognize various emotions from facial images, enabling applications in areas such as sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction.

## Project Structure

Ensure that the dataset is located in the same directory as this `main.ipynb` file, under a folder named `AffectNet`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

Clone this repository or download the files.
Ensure that the AffectNet dataset is correctly placed in the AffectNet folder.
Open main.ipynb and run the cells to train and evaluate the model.

# Dataset
The AffectNet dataset can be found on Kaggle. This dataset contains images labeled with different emotions, allowing for training machine learning models for emotional classification.
